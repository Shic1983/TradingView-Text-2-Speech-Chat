#TradingView-Text-2-Speech-Chat
==============================

Converts the text in the chat on trading view to speech

###Instructions:
* Open chrome developer console (crt+shift+j)
* Go to 'Console' tab
* Paste in contents of this file

### Bugs:
* Sometimes after alot of activity will crash the chrome window

### Improvements to be done: 
* HTML5 Audio object instead of this crappy <embed>
* Queuing system with some propagation.. maybe a kill the queue on a queue limit when chat is firing away.
